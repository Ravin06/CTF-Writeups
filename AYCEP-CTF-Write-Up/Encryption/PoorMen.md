# Poor Men

## Challenge Brief
```
Your party stumbles across a group of poor men begging
for scraps. Only the leader of the beggars seems to be
able-bodied the rest seem to be horribly maimed with
missing limbs. Understanding their plight, you reach in to
find your purse, sighing at the sight of pus oozing out of the
open wounds of the beggars. Shaking your purse, you pull
out a few copper coins. Of course you would have given
more, but your team was just ambushed by a group of
goblins and this small amount is all you have left. Perhaps
your party could have evaded the party if the team's wizard
hadn't been so slow with casting spells, you think to
yourself as you angrily eye your party member Oliver a
nervous wreck of a wizard who can barely lift a wand. Only,
it's pointless to blame an ally, however useless they might
be in battle. Resisting the urge to place a hex on the wizard,
as punishment for the team's misfortune, you empty the
contents of your purse into the waiting hands of a beggar
and lead your party on to the next adventure.
